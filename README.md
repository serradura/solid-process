### Examples <!-- omit in toc -->

Check out [Solid Rails App](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app) for a complete example of how to use `solid-process` in a Rails application. [Twelve versions (branches)](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app?tab=readme-ov-file#-repository-branches) show how the gem can be incrementally integrated, access it to see from simple services/form objects to implementing the ports and adapters (hexagonal) architectural pattern.

You can also check the [examples](examples) directory for more simple examples of how to use the gem.

<p align="right"><a href="#-table-of-contents-">‚¨ÜÔ∏è &nbsp;back to top</a></p>

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add solid-process

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install solid-process

And require it in your code:

    require 'solid/process'

<p align="right"><a href="#-table-of-contents-">‚¨ÜÔ∏è &nbsp;back to top</a></p>

## The Basic Structure

All `Solid::Process` requires at least two things: an `input` and a `call` method.

1. The `input` is a set of attributes needed to perform the work.
2. The `#call` method is the entry point and where the work is done.
  - It receives the attributes Hash (symbolized keys), defined by the `input`.
  - It returns a `Success` or `Failure` as the output.

```ruby
class User::Creation < Solid::Process
  input do
    # Define the attributes needed to perform the work
  end

  def call(attributes)
    # Perform the work and return a Success or Failure as the output
  end
end
```

#### Example <!-- omit in toc -->

```ruby
class User::Creation < Solid::Process
  input do
    attribute :email
    attribute :password
    attribute :password_confirmation
  end

  def call(attributes)
    user = User.create(attributes)

    if user.persisted?
      Success(:user_created, user: user)
    else
      Failure(:user_not_created, user: user)
    end
  end
end
```

<p align="right"><a href="#-table-of-contents-">‚¨ÜÔ∏è &nbsp;back to top</a></p>

### Calling a Process <!-- omit from toc -->

To call a process, you can use the `call` method directly, or instantiate the class and call the `#call` method.

```ruby
###############
# Direct call #
###############

User::Creation.call(email: 'john.doe@email.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password')
# => #<Solid::Output::Success type=:user_created value={:user=>#<User id: 1, ...>}>

########################
# Instantiate and call #
########################

process = User::Creation.new

process.call(email: 'john.doe@email.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password')
```

For now, it's essential to know that a process instance is stateful, and because of this, you can call it only once.

```ruby
process = User::Creation.new

input = {email: 'john.doe@email.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password'}

process.call(input)

process.call(input)
# The `User::Creation#output` is already set. Use `.output` to access the result or create a new instance to call again. (Solid::Process::Error)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake dev` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank some people who helped me by testing and giving feedback as this project took shape, they are:

- [Diego Linhares](https://github.com/diegolinhares) and [Ralf Schmitz Bongiolo](https://github.com/mrbongiolo) they were the brave ones who worked for a few months with the first versions of the ecosystem (it was called B/CDD). Their feedback was essential for improving DX and helped me to pivot some core decisions.
- [Vitor Avelino](https://github.com/vitoravelino), [Tom√°s Co√™lho](https://github.com/tomascco), [Haroldo Furtado](https://github.com/haroldofurtado) (I could repeat Ralf and Diego again) for the various feedbacks, documentation, API, support and words of encouragement.

## About

[Rodrigo Serradura](https://rodrigoserradura.com) created this project. He is the Solid Process creator and has already made similar gems like the [u-case](https://github.com/serradura/u-case) and [kind](https://github.com/serradura/kind). This gem can be used independently, but it also contains essential features that facilitate the adoption of Solid Process (the method) in code.
